      <h3>Our Company Ethics</h3>
      <b>1. Commitment</b>
      <p>Not to be confused with committing to a particular delivery date or predefined set of functionality, commitment describes the trust the team places in the agile approach and its values. </p>
      <b>2. Courage</b>
      <p>Courage empowers members of an organization to speak up and call out unethical behavior by management that can influence work being produced. Many organizations believe that "if you don't say anything, the bad decision will disappear." But, in today's globally connected world, decisions do not disappear quickly, so company leaders need to act responsibility. </p>
      <b>3. Focus</b>
      <p>Instead of working independently, teams are more effective when they collaborate on small sets of customer-driven outcomes. This is why company leaders should empower their teams to tackle the most important tasks first as they work toward a final product. </p>
      <b>4. Respect</b>
      <p>Above all else, company leaders should respect their team members' diverse backgrounds, experiences and range of skills. Showing respect for team members and assuming they have good intentions can lead to conversations.</p>
