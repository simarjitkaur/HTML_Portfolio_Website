      <h3>Goal</h3>
      <p>
        There are four main purposes to the application:
        <ul>
           <li>Ability to view different basemaps as a backdrop.</li>
           <li>Ability to view a population map that shows scaled symbols based on the population size.</li>
           <li>Ability to navigate to 5 locations of your choice around the world.</li>
           <li>Ability to click on a map symbol and view three attributes for that symbol.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        To create this application,I use many of the concepts I have learned in class.
