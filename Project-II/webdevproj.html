      <center><h3>Project 1</h3></center>
      <h3>Subject</h3>
      <p>
        Basic HTML 5 Web Page with CSS
      </p>
      <h3>Outcomes</h3>
      <p>
        In this project, I required to demonstrate to the best extent of my skills, my expertise using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
      </p>
      <h3>Expectations</h3>
      <p>
        As a current student of the Confederation College, and a employ candidate for these companies, the job is to select one the areas in industry and develop the interface of a survey.

        The team is only developing the interface. So, no authentication is required. However, the team is required to properly define the navigation among the pages.

        Avoid as much as possible repeating code. Use Javascript and create function when possible. Properly named functions decrease the number of comments.

        Well commented code is required. Specially for code that was copied and pasted. For these, I expect every step to be well commented.
